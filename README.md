Source code to the [StellarLite.io](https://stellarlite.io) wallet and trading tool.
For your personal key security please audit this html & javascript code visually before saving and running the StellarLite tool in any web browser.

To audit the code simply scroll through and make sure that there are no URLs in there which link to anything other than the stellar.org horizon.
If there is a link to anywhere else then this could be an attack trying to steal your private key. By spending a few minutes scrolling through the plaintext code you can be sure there is nothing nasty hidden within.

If you would like to contribute some code to this open source tool please feel free to contact admin at stellarlite.io
